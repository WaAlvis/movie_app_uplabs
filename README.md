# MovieApp Uplabs
  
The project follows the principles of **Clean Architecture** to guarantee a modular and maintainable structure. Use the **flutter_bloc** package to manage states, leveraging both *Cubit* and *Bloc* as needed.

The project architecture is designed to be versatile and is compatible with various platforms, including the *Web*, thanks to the implementation of **Deep Linking**.

Comprehensive **documentation** has been provided for the Bloc section, including details on *BloC states, events, and logic* to improve team understanding and collaboration.

Smooth image **transitions** when scrolling the details screen enhance the user experience, providing an attractive and *easy-to-use* interface.

**Infinite Scroll** has been implemented on the home page to dynamically load more content as the user scrolls, improving *efficiency* and *usability*.
